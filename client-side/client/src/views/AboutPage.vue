      <p>Welcome to Nekomics!</p>
      <p>I created this website with the sole purpose of enriching my knowledge in the field of programming, focusing specifically on the JavaScript language, while also using it as a platform to showcase and build up my portfolio. Through this project, I aim to immerse myself in practical coding challenges, experiment with various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, and gain hands-on experience in web development.</p>
      <p>By incorporating the design inspirations from websites like <a href="https://alandal.com/" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC304B] hover:text-[#E32B43] cursor-pointer">Alandal</a> and <a href="https://realmscans.xyz/" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC304B] hover:text-[#E32B43] cursor-pointer">Realmscans</a>, I sought to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface for my website. However, I want to emphasize that while I drew inspiration from these sources, I ensured that all the code and content I used were either original or appropriately attributed to their respective sources, adhering to ethical and legal practices.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I want to credit MangaDex for providing the manga data and chapter images through their API. The manga data and chapter images displayed on this website are sourced from <a href="https://api.mangadex.org/docs/" target="_blank" class="text-[#FC304B] hover:text-[#E32B43] cursor-pointer">MangaDex API</a>, and I am grateful for their valuable resources.</p>
      <p>It is essential to clarify that this website does not generate any profits, and I have intentionally kept it ad-free and devoid of any commercial aspects. It exists solely for educational purposes and personal growth, with a focus on honing my programming skills and expanding my expertise in JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I would be more than happy to receive feedback and constructive criticism from visitors to improve the website continually. For those interested in reaching out to me, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:alfalakhie@gmail.com" class="underline">Alfalakhie@gmail.com</a> or find detailed contact information in the footer, specifically under the <span class="text-[#FC304B]">"Contact Us"</span> section.</p>
